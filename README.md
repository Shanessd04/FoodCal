## üìå Project Overview

**FoodCal** is a deep learning-powered nutrition analysis app that takes an image of Indian food and predicts:
- üçõ Dish Name
- üß¨ Nutrition Breakdown: **Calories, Protein, Fat, Carbohydrates**

Built using **TensorFlow (MobileNetV2)** and deployed via a sleek **Streamlit web app**, FoodCal offers instant nutrition insights from just a photo.

## üß† Model Highlights

- ‚úÖ **Model:** MobileNetV2 with fine-tuning
- ‚úÖ **Input Shape:** 224√ó224√ó3 (RGB food images)
- ‚úÖ **Output:** Softmax predictions across Indian food classes
- ‚úÖ **Dataset:** Custom Indian food dataset (~20 classes, images only)
- ‚úÖ **Nutrition Mapping:** Linked with a manually curated CSV file

## ‚öôÔ∏è How it Works

1. **User uploads a food image**
2. The model predicts the dish (e.g., *Aloo Gobi*)
3. The system looks up nutrition from a CSV file (`indian_food_nutrition.csv`)
4. Output:
   - Dish name + confidence
   - Nutrition per serving (calories, protein, fat, carbs)
